# Minds On
This solution made use of a mobile brainwave headset receiver to detect the user brainwave and transmit the signal to a mobile phone to process the signal. The mobile phone will send a command through the intranet to webserver to control the relays connected to the lightings or electrical appliances.

The solution is designed to be ease of use and can connect to any lighting and electrical appliances. The relays are connected to the electrical mains and are concealed in a casing to prevent any electricity shock hazard.
